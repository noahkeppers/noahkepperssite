## Project Context
### Project Brief
Students were tasked with designing a new faceplate for the Ventra kiosks used to pay for public transport in Chicago. The scope of the project included only printed materials - the kiosk’s hardware and software (including anything displayed onscreen) were to remain unchanged.

### My Goals
In my research, many Chicagoans who are frequent Ventra users barely look at the printed material on Ventra machines. Therefore, I decided to focus on the "rental car" scenario - users who are new to the Ventra and CTA systems.

## My Solution
### Fare Structure
Before potential users can even interact with the kiosk, they must determine what to buy. This requires understanding the Ventra system and CTA fare structure. Current printed materials at the top of the kiosk are incredibly detailed, making them difficult to scan. In order to better explain such a complex system, I focused on providing clarity and organization, moving some fare information to the main kiosk and reorganizing the rest.

### Purchase Flow
After deciding what to purchase, users must make a selection and pay. The current design separates the kiosk into different areas, but does little in the way of guiding users through the ordered process of making a purchase. On the main kiosk, I focused on providing sequence while maintaing consistent labeling of the kiosk inputs.

</div>

## Process
### Research
My redesign started with class research. With a group of two other students, I observed users at the CTA Sox-35th station and interviewed a CTA employee about the kiosks. Insights were analyzed as a class using the 5 E's framework.

I also documented both the digital (UI) and physical (kiosk ports/inputs) flows a user might experience while using the kiosk. When creating my solution, I attempted to make these sequences more salient.

### Exploration
I explored several directions on paper before moving forward in InDesign.

## Key Learnings
### Designing for Public Use
Public fixtures like the Ventra kiosk serve a variety of different users from incredibly diverse backgrounds. Though public designs must serve as many of these people as possible, trade-offs are almost always necessary, and it's important that these decisions are made with intention.

### Retrofitting
The well-defined briefs and creative freedom in design school don't always reflect the realities of the practice. Working within the constraints of the current kiosk system was often challenging, especially without sacrificing usability.
