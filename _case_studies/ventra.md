## Project Context
### Project Brief
Design a new faceplate for the Ventra kiosks used to pay for public transport in Chicago. The scope of the project included only printed materials - the kiosk’s hardware and software (including anything displayed onscreen) were to remain unchanged.

### My Goals
Many Chicagoans who are frequent Ventra users barely look at the printed material on Ventra machines. Therefore, I decided to focus on the "rental car" scenario - users who are new to the Ventra and CTA systems.

## Process
### Research
My redesign started with class research. With a group of two other students, I observed users at the CTA Sox-35th station and interviewed a CTA employee about the kiosks. We then shared our findings with the rest of the class and developed insights using the 5 E's framework.

I also documented both the physical (kiosk ports/inputs) and digital (UI) flows a user might experience while using the kiosk. When creating my solution, I attempted to make these sequences more salient.

</div>

### Exploration
I explored several directions on paper before moving forward in InDesign.

</div>

## My Solution
### Fare Structure
Before potential users can even interact with the kiosk, they must determine what to buy. Current printed materials at the top of the kiosk are incredibly dense, making it difficult to understand the different CTA fares. In order to better explain such a complex system, I focused on providing clarity and organization, moving some fare information to the main kiosk and reorganizing the rest.

### Purchase Flow
After deciding what to purchase, users must make a selection and pay. The current design separates the kiosk into different areas, but does little in the way of guiding users through the ordered process of making a purchase. On the main kiosk, I focused on providing sequence while maintaing consistent labeling of the kiosk inputs.

## Key Learnings
### Designing for Public Use
Public fixtures like the Ventra kiosk serve a variety of different users from incredibly diverse backgrounds. Though public designs must serve as many of these people as possible, trade-offs are almost always necessary, and it's important that these decisions are made with intention.

### Retrofitting
The well-defined briefs and creative freedom in design school don't always reflect the realities of design practice. Working within the constraints of the current kiosk system was often challenging, especially without sacrificing usability.
