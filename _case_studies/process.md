## Project Context
### Project Brief
Describe a process on a single 11x17 page using type, photography, and illustration.

### My Goals
When I learned to bake bread, I found most recipes to be very prescriptive, with little explanation of the "why" behind each step. My solution aims to describe baking sandwich bread without jargon and with descriptions of the science behind each step.

## Process
### Content
I based my bread-baking instructions on [the recipe I use most frequently](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/2m2rye/ysk_how_to_make_bread/), adding tips from my personal experience as necessary.

### Exploration
I sketched several directions for both layout and iconography before creating the final composition.

<div class="two-col">
  {%- include image.html src="/assets/process/sketch1.jpg" alt="Sketch showing the initial layout of the composition" caption="Initial layout sketching" -%}
  {%- include image.html src="/assets/process/sketch2.jpg" alt="Sketching exploring icons used in the composition" caption="Exploring icons" -%}
</div>

## My Solution
<div>
{%- include image.html src="/assets/process/process.jpg" alt="My process composition (click for PDF)" caption="(Click for PDF)" href="/assets/process/process.pdf" -%}
</div>

## Key Learnings
### Content-driven design
The sheer number of details involved in breadmaking meant that I had to consider my recipe content before I even thought about sketching a layout. Writing my recipe text ahead of time and carefully considering each photo I would need made my actual implementation much smoother than previous assignments. Planning is key!


### Visual Dynamism
As a new information designer, I often focused on structure over form. This assignment was the first time in the 14-week course where I made a conscious effort to present information in a visually dynamic way. My aesthetic eye still has a long way to go, but I'm making a conscious effort to develop it going forward.
