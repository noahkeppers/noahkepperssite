## Project Context
### Project Brief
Describe a process on a single 11x17 page using type, photography, and illustration.

### My Goals
When I learned to bake bread, I found most recipes to be very prescriptive, with little explanation of the "why" behind each step. My solution aims to describe baking sandwich bread without jargon and with descriptions of the science behind each step.

## My Solution
<div>
{%- include image.html src="/assets/process/process.jpg" alt="My process composition (click for PDF)" caption="(Click for PDF)" href="/assets/process/process.pdf" -%}
</div>

## Process
### Content
I based my bread-baking instructions on [the recipe I use most frequently](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/2m2rye/ysk_how_to_make_bread/), adding tips from my personal experience as necessary.

### Exploration
I sketched several directions for both layout and iconography before creating the final composition.

<div class="two-col">
  {%- include image.html src="/assets/process/sketch1.jpg" alt="Sketch showing the initial layout of the composition" caption="Initial layout sketching" -%}
  {%- include image.html src="/assets/process/sketch2.jpg" alt="Sketching exploring icons used in the composition" caption="Exploring icons" -%}
</div>

## Key Learnings
### Content-driven design
The sheer number of details involved in breadmaking meant that I had to consider my recipe content before I even thought about sketching a layout. Writing my recipe text ahead of time and carefully considering each photo I would need made my actual implementation much smoother than previous assignments. Planning is key!


### Visual Dynamism
As a new information designer, I often focused on structure over aesthetics. This assignment was one of the first times in the course where I was able to consider the content's form and meaning as two sides of the same coin - interrelated forces instead of opposing ones.
