## Project Context
### Project Brief
Develop a game for people with disabilities using inclusive design principles.

### My Goals
The pace of my Foundation semester left minimal time for in-depth user research, and I didn't want to design for a population without understanding their needs. Therefore, I focused on designing for mental health, specifically anxiety and depression - two conditions I have personal experience with.

## Process
### Exploration
<div class="two-col">
  <div style="align-self: start">
    <p>I knew I wanted to develop a game for mental health from the beginning, but I wasn't quite sure what form it would take. My first concept was a video game that aimed to teach self-discovery through interpersonal connection. Players would work together to explore their individual identity, symbolized by puzzle pieces in a heart-shaped container.</p>
    <p>However, I didn't feel that I would be able to develop a clear concept and create testable prototypes for such a complex project in two weeks.</p>

### Switching Gears
Instead, I changed directions to focus on a writing game for mental health - this concept had a smaller scope and less technological complexities, making it much more achievable in the project time frame. I needed to get my initial concepts in front of users quickly so I could determine which mechanics were fun to play. Focusing on a physical concept allowed me to prototype easily (first with index cards, then in Illustrator), which made testing much more flexible.

## My Solution
Compose draws on several stream-of-consciousness writing practices including [James Pennebaker's expressive writing studies](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/psychology/faculty/pennebak#writing-health) and [Julia Cameron's morning pages](https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/). Players write in stream of consciousness for two minutes about a shared topic, share their favorite phrases, and combine them into a collaborative poem (each player contributes one line). 

Compose has two main goals: 
- to bring players together as they share their thoughts and feelings
- to teach players how to journal so they can apply the practice in their lives

## Key Learnings
### Divergence and Convergence
The design process is much more linear on paper than it is in reality. When my first idea didn't fit the project timeline, I had to change my perspective and start ideating all over again.

### Objectivity and Design
Though I still believe drawing on my personal experience strengthened my concept, it was incredibly difficult to separate my own perspective during user feedback and class critique. Sometimes it's impossible for designers to completely detach their own opinions from a project, which can be both an asset and a liability.
