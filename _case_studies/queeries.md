## Project Context
### Project Brief
Students were tasked with designing a content library app for browsing and playing movies (similar to Netflix).

### My Goals
Content libraries are a fairly established interface design pattern, so I decided to make the brief more personal by bringing in my own identities and interests. Queeries is an LGBTQ cinema app that allows people who are unfamiliar with the queer community (straight/cis allies, newly out queer people, etc.) to learn more about its culture.

## Functionality
### Browsing
Queeries provides recommendations and curated content to introduce users to queer films.

### Searching
The app also allows users to search for movies based on a variety of filters, including the identities the film showcases.

### Playback
During playback, Queeries provides information about the onscreen queer topics, people, and identities.

## Guiding Principles
### Education through Culture
Queeries aims to teach queer identities through the films that portray it. As users browse and watch movies, queer terms and identities are highlighted in blue - any highlighted item can be tapped to provide definitions and deeper context.

### Supporting Growth
As users learn more about queer culture, Queeries grows with them. The app provides curated content based on the individiual user's experience level as well as spaces for users to ask questions and participate in film discussions.

## Process
### Exploration
Before I decided to target individuals with limited queer experience, I explored three different audiences' needs when searching and filtering movies.

### Dataset
Example app data were sourced from [Rotten Tomatoes's 200 Best LGBT Movies](https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/best-lgbt-movies-of-all-time/), the [online Bechdel Test Database](https://bechdeltest.com/search/), and [Wikipedia's LGBT Film List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_with_LGBT_characters).

## Key Learnings
### Target Audiences
I had to think hard about my target user base during this project to prevent scope creep. Initially, the app aimed to provide movie recommendations for members of the queer community as well, but serving both audiences meant I was unable to truly focus on either.

### Audience Evolution
The end goal of this project is learning - if the app does its job, users' frame of reference will change over time. Thinking about the ways audience members might evolve over time led to the addition of features for more advanced users like curated recommendations and identity-based filters.
