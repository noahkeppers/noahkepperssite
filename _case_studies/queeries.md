## Project Context
### Project Brief
Design wireframes for a content library app for browsing and playing movies.

### My Goals
Content libraries are a fairly common design paradigm, and I see little reason to reinvent the wheel unnecessarily. Therefore, I decided to make the brief more relevant to my personal interests by bringing in my own experiences and identities. Queeries is an LGBTQ cinema app that allows people who are unfamiliar with the queer community (straight/cis allies, newly out queer people, etc.) to learn more about its culture.

## Functionality
### Browsing
Queeries provides recommendations and curated content to introduce users to queer films. As users browse and watch movies, queer terms and identities are highlighted in blue - any highlighted item can be tapped to provide definitions and deeper context.

### Searching
The app also allows users to search for movies based on a variety of filters, including the identities the film showcases.

### Playback
During playback, Queeries provides information about the onscreen queer topics, people, and identities.

## Process
### Exploration
Before I decided to target individuals with limited queer experience, I explored three different audiences' needs when searching and filtering movies.

From left to right: 'new to queer identities & new to queer cinema,' 'Knowledge of queer identities & new to queer cinema,' and 'Knowledge of queer identities & knowledge of queer cinema'" caption="Exploring filtering based on understanding of queer terminology and familiarity with LGBTQ cinema" -%}

### Example Data
I used realistic text/images for this project (as opposed to placeholders) whenever possible.

Example app data were sourced from [Rotten Tomatoes's 200 Best LGBT Movies](https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/best-lgbt-movies-of-all-time/), the [online Bechdel Test Database](https://bechdeltest.com/search/), and [Wikipedia's LGBT Film List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_with_LGBT_characters).

## Key Learnings
### Target Audiences
I had to think hard about my target user base during this project to prevent scope creep. Initially, the app aimed to provide movie recommendations for members of the queer community as well, but serving both audiences meant I was unable to truly focus on either.

### Audience Evolution
The end goal of this project is learning - if the app does its job, users' frame of reference will change over time. Thinking about the ways audience members might evolve over time led to the addition of features for more advanced users like curated recommendations and identity-based filters.
